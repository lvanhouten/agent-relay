# Conduct gate log — rendered-screen-read-output

Append-only record of the conducted run: entry point, stage completions, gates, and mid-stage approvals.

## Run entry — 2026-07-07

- **Feature:** rendered-screen-read-output
- **Entry:** full-span, `--from execute-briefs` (default). Cold start — no prior `conduct/` trail.
- **Conductor cwd / branch:** `C:\Users\Lukas5856\worktrees\agent-relay\rendered-screen` on `feat/rendered-screen-read-output`.
- **Preconditions:** ✅ PRD + validation-contract.md (11 assertions VC-1..VC-11) + 4 briefs + planning artifacts committed; working tree clean; board reachable; allowlist coverage confirmed by user; FIRST-USE validated (see below).
- **Stage plan:** execute-briefs → adversarial-review → remediate-batch → verify → contract-check. Contract present → contract-check is a real (non-vacuous) pass.

### FIRST-USE validation — 2026-07-07 (all steps passed)

1. Board reachability — ✅
2. Spawn + bootstrap round-trip — ✅ (2 live-vs-doc mismatches found & corrected in LINE-OPS.md)
3. Marker round-trip (write + commit + `git show HEAD:`) — ✅
4. Backgrounded transcript watcher — ✅ (transcript-idle + marker-present + Conductor stayed responsive)
4b. Prompt-detection round-trip — ✅ (pending `tool_use` + exact command text from transcript; PTY dialog box obscured by spinner animation, so transcript is the reliable discriminator)
5. Paging — facility present (`PushNotification`); suppressed while terminal active; live phone delivery unverified (needs Remote Control + inactive terminal). Joinable-Line channel is the backstop.
6. Graceful teardown + trust persistence — ✅

**Corrections applied to LINE-OPS.md (verified live):**
- Spawn recipe must clear `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION` before `claude`, else board-spawned sessions write no transcript JSONL (kills watcher + prompt-detection).
- `send_input {submit:true}` does not submit into the Claude TUI; every prompt/answer needs a *separate bare-Enter* send.

## Mid-stage approvals (judged, non-deny-class)

- **2026-07-07 · execute-briefs** — Approved: `brief-executor` (brief 01-screen-render) creating file `_spike.js` in its isolated worktree (an xterm/headless frame-tearing spike/experiment script). **Reasoning:** in-worktree file creation, no outbound/external effect, no destruction outside the worktree, no credential/secret in the action — squarely within the Conductor's judgment per the authority contract; not deny-class.
- **2026-07-07 · execute-briefs** — Approved (full command text): `rm "C:/Users/Lukas5856/worktrees/agent-relay/rendered-screen/.claude/wt/01/server/board/_spike.js" && echo removed` — `brief-executor` (brief 01) cleaning up the spike file it just created, in its isolated worktree `.claude/wt/01/`. **Reasoning:** single explicit-path `rm` (no `-rf`), target inside the brief's own worktree, no destruction outside the feature worktree, no external/secret aspect — not deny-class.
- **2026-07-07 · execute-briefs** — Approved: `Write` of `.claude/wt/01/server/board/screen-render.js` (brief 01's main feature file — the byte-stream→rendered-screen transform over @xterm/headless), in the brief's isolated worktree. **Reasoning:** in-worktree file write, no destruction outside the feature worktree, no external/secret aspect — not deny-class. NOTE: brief-executor Write/rm/Bash tools are not allow-listed, causing per-file-op stalls; raised with user for an allowlist fix.
